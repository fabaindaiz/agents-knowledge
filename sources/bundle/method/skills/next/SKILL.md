# Next

A session that asks what to do next needs a choice it can make in one look, not the roadmap read back. So
the answer is three actions, each tied to a fact just read, and one question; the rest waits behind
*review more*. Nothing runs until the user chooses.

## 1. Read, in seconds

- **git**: the branch, its upstream (commits not pushed, behind), uncommitted changes and whose they are, a
  merge or rebase in progress. Do not fetch.
- **The hand-off**: the roadmap's *Where we are* or the repository's equivalent, and the last entry of the
  session log (`carrier.toml`'s `log`, by default `.claude/logs/agent-changelog.md`). Where there is none,
  say so and use git and the root file's map.
- **The checks that take seconds**: `bundle.py verify` and `install-skills --check`. Skip a slower one and say so.
- **This conversation**: a process in course (a decision walk, a plan being run) and the actions the user
  already declined.

## 2. The candidates

From the hand-off's next items and what waits on the user, the moments in `skills/README.md` (*Skills from
elsewhere, and the moment each fits*), and what the reads found: a red check, unpushed or unmerged work, a long
session with no close. A step this repository's own procedure does differently is proposed its way.

## 3. Rank

1. A process in course: continuing it is option 1, where it stands said.
2. What blocks the rest: a red check, a conflict, uncommitted work of unknown owner.
3. What waits only on the user's word.
4. The rest, cheapest first where they are worth the same.

An action the user declined in this conversation leaves the top three unless it is rank 2; then it returns
with "you declined it; it still blocks".

## 4. The answer, in this shape and the user's language

1. **Read:** one line of what was read and what was missing.
2. **Three actions**, recommended first, each one line: the action · its cost (minutes, hours, tokens) · why
   now, naming the fact from step 1 that puts it here.
3. **One question:** which one, or *review more* for every candidate by kind (continue, decide, review, close,
   release, research), each with its cost.

## 5. After the choice

The chosen action starts in its own mode (its skill, its paste box, its pre-flight). Choosing it is not
approval for what that action asks permission for. A long one runs in the background. If the user talks
about something else instead, `next` is over.
