description: "Two jobs on how people use an app: answers the human's observations from using it (something not working, jumping, hidden or slow), each reproduced and fixed test-first; and walks a flow, the ideal path then every delay, interruption, failure and misuse, the kept ones as failing tests. Use it whenever a request is about what a person does or meets in the app: something seen while using it, a usability or interaction change (controls, keys, menus, animations), a flow to design around the user, or what someone meets when a step is slow or cut off. Not for an error message or trace alone (debug it), testing with real people, or reviewing decisions."

# User walk

Imagined flows find dead ends and missing states early, but an agent walking alone walks the ideal
path; the delays and setbacks came from the human's own use. So the walk lists every way a flow goes
wrong **before** handling any, and what it produces are tests and hypotheses, never evidence about
real users.

## Before it starts: the pre-review

This process is long. Before its first step, one message: the important questions still open for it, at most four,
each with a recommendation, found by cheap reads only (`git status`, the hand-off, a review pending, `proposed`
decision rows), such as which of its two jobs (the human's observations, or a walk of one flow), which flow, whether
a fix may ship before the walk ends; and, unless the human asked for this process by name or command, whether to run
it in full. Asked for by name and nothing open: start. Each answer is written where it belongs (a decision row, the
roadmap, the plan) even when the human declines the process, and goes in with the session's next commit
(`d-5ed7e8-d7c0b7`).

## 1. Actors and goals

Who uses it (from the repository's personas or data where they exist; say so when they are assumed),
what each wants, and who would misuse it.

## 2. The ideal flows

For each goal, the main success scenario in three to nine steps, each an action and what the user sees.
With a user interface, ask at each step: is it the user's goal now, is the action visible, does it read
as the way to that goal, and does the user see progress after it?

## 3. Every way it goes wrong, listed before any is handled

For each step:

- **delays**: a slow answer, a long operation, a wait with no end, a timeout;
- **interruptions**: the app closed or sent to the background, the network lost, the device locked or
  restarted, the session expired, a second instance, a call in the middle;
- **setbacks**: a wrong input, a change of mind, back or undo, a double submit, a half-finished task,
  coming back days later;
- **failures**: a dependency down, a partial write, a full disk or quota, a stale cache, a conflicting
  edit, a clock that is wrong;
- **misuse**: what the unwelcome user tries.

Then a **premortem**: it shipped and users lost work or gave up — why? Written apart from the list,
then merged. The knowledge cards on failure behaviour (`.agents/knowledge/INDEX.md`) name what this kind
of system usually gets wrong.

## 4. Merge, price, decide

Merge the duplicates. Price each case: how likely, and what it costs the user unhandled (lost work, a
wrong result, a wait, confusion), in the repository's units where it has them. For each one kept, say
where it ends: back in the flow, another success, or a failure the user can see and recover from. A
handling choice that is the human's goes to `decision-review`. The rest are recorded as not handled,
with why.

## 5. Tests first

Each case kept becomes one Given/When/Then and then a test that fails before the code (principle 18),
named after the behaviour, with the clock and the boundaries injected. More than about twenty kept for
one flow: split the feature.

## 6. Widen once, and say what it is

Optionally, a fresh subagent walks the same flow without seeing the list; merge what is new (two
walkers find largely different problems). Report the walk as hypotheses, and name the cheapest real
check when the stakes call for one: the human using the build, a few users thinking aloud, telemetry.

## When the human reports from real use

Each observation in the batch is answered by name in the report, none skipped:

1. reproduce it on the closest stand-in for the human's device (the same screen geometry, the same
   build), with a capture; tests on the human's real device read data only and change nothing;
2. fix it with a test that fails first;
3. sweep its class: every other place the same cause can show, not only the one reported;
4. add the case to the walk above, so the next feature is walked against it.

## Hands off to

Test-first implementation (a test-driven skill if one is installed, or principle 18), in the order the
cases were kept; a plan, whose per-task tests are these; `decision-review` for the handling choices
that are the human's.
